"""
    parse_args(args)

Parse the command line arguments to get the included and excluded test file paths.

The arguments are expected to be in the form:
```
a b c --skip d e f
```
where a test file is to be included if and only if
1) the argument list is empty, in which case all files are included,
or
2)
    a) it has as a substring of its path any of the strings `a`, `b`, or `c`,
    and
    b) it does not have as a substring of its path any of the strings `d`, `e`, or `f`.

The substring checks are done case-insensitively.
